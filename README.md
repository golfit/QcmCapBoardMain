This Verilog code was written in 2011-2012 for a project at the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center, Alcator C-Mod tokamak.  It was ultimately used to program Altera EPM7128SLC84-15 CPLD's to actuate solid-state switching for a matching network.  This, in turn, coupled two radio-frequency 50-ohm sources (T&C AG1010's, 20 kHz-1 MHz, 1 kW) to an antenna mounted inside the tokamak vacuum vessel (L~=6 uH, R~=0.5 ohms).

Note that there was a lot of hacking in this project, and the code here may not be up-to-date or even working, so user beware!
